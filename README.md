### Why you should follow this repository?
As a work seeker I solved many leetcode, interviewbit and much more problems but was unable
to find the most efficient solution with explanation.

This repository will help you with solution and explanations. Easy to access
and time saver before the interview. 

Feel free to submit pull requests, add issues and questions and maybe be a contributer.
